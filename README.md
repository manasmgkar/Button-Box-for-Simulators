This Project was Born as i could not afford to Buy expensive Board's like the leopard bb2 quick connect ones etc to build a realistic experience for Euro truck sim 2 and flight sim.Living in a Third world nation,these things are expensive and hard to come by so i decide to use whatever was available to me.
I learned a lot also made some mistakes and this repo aims to document the How-To and what not to and everything in between including the code. 

### Hardware Required
1. Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Mega(i made the mistake of not using this and went for the smaller leonardo instead, i built this during semi-condutor shortage thus couldn't find the mega).
2. If using The Leonardo a Tx/sx extension
3. 9x On-On switches, i used omron one's cheaper one's are available
4. 3x On-Off-On Switches
5. 1x Push switch
6. 1x Push tactile switch
7. 2x Led On-off switches one Green one Red
8. 2x Rotary Encoders
9. 2x Pull Switches(to simulate airbrake, parking brake)
10. 1x push switch(engine start,actual automotive/truck spare part)
11. 1x Relistic Key switch(to simulate electics start,Actual automotive/truck spare part)
12. 4x Led's (2 red, 1 yellow, 1 green) to wire up start and give a realistic feel
13. 1x usb cable that connectes to your arduino
14. 1x Electrical Panel Box or Project box as per your liking(I got a generic electrical one,the cheapest i could find).You can build this even in a custom made wooden box.
15. Lots of female female/dupoint quick connect cables(i made the mistake of using small 0.18mm spade conenct switches and soldered) rather use dupoint pin Switches. Or use spade connectors,whatever that you want.
